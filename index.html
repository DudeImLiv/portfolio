				<p id="indexMain">Building a business or organization can be overwhelming. You are expected to think of marketing and promotional materials, your logo and website design, the design of your invoices and email campaigns, your business cards and fliers; don't forget things like your employee handbook and other business materials! Whether you are just starting out or you need to re-design your brand, send us an e-mail to get started!</p>

								One of Liv.ing Design's oldest clients (the people who were there when this all began nearly two decades ago!) needs artwork that stands out for certain projects. This year, he needed designs for teams of stickball players. These were screen-printed onto tee shirts by the client but the client recieved 6 mockups, a PDF, a JPEG, SVG & PNG. Additional formats available upon request such as .psd, .ai, etc.

								Another up and coming tee shirt printer came to Liv.ing Design for a custom design for her to print for resell. This design was printed on an actual tee shirt printer therefore was made very detailed and took more time colors than many tee shirt designs. These were printed onto tee shirts by the client but the client recieved 6 mockups, a PDF, a JPEG, SVG & PNG. Additional formats available upon request such as .psd, .ai, etc.
